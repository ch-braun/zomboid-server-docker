# Zomboid Docker Server

Hello, I am a project which is not affiliated with any official Zomboid project. I am a Docker image that is designed to run a Project Zomboid server.

I am not even affiliated with anything official at all. I am just a hobby project.

## Where do I find the save files on my host?

Depends on the Docker installation. If you are running Docker on Linux, the save files will be in the `/var/lib/docker/volumes/zomboid-server-data/_data` directory.

## How do I install mods?
